# Discord-Sever-Joiner


Hello there! 
First I would like to thank you for using this script. People like you are the resaon I continue making scripts despite the people who hate on me for using python.
Anyways, let's get to the reason why you're here shall we? :D

When you go into the main.py, all you need to change it the "Init = Controller1Master("your server here")"
When you change it, it should work.
If you do not have python installed, please install it. This is made with GeckoDriver as well, so just download GeckoDriver or ChromeDriver and specify your path in
like this:
"Controller1 = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/usr/local/bin/geckodriver')"
or:
"Controller1 = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/usr/local/bin/webdriver')"

And don't worry about the import statements, if you don't have the package installed, the bot automatically installs them for you :D
Anyawys, thakns for using this program ::))
